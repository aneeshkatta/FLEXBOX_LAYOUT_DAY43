        <article><h2>First Article</h1><p1>An author is a person who writes books, stories, poems, or other written work. Their writing can be truth or fiction, short or long. Often, author is a word for a professional writer, but any person who writes may also be called that.</p1></article>
            <article><h2>Second Article</h2><p2>Sometimes, a person who creates something that is not prose is called an author. Someone who writes music may be called the author of that piece of music, though we would usually call that person a composer. </p2></article>
            <article><h3>Third Article</h3><p3> There are so many great writers and novelists from India and of Indian origin, in the English language, that it is difficult to keep the list short.</p3></article>
